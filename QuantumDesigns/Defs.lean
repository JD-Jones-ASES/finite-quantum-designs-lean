# Definitions

The definitions of `Challenge.lean` (formal-conjectures' vocabulary for Open Quantum Problems 13 and 23, Apache-2.0,
see NOTICE), restated character for character with the same import (`Mathlib`), so that every definition elaborates
to the same term in both files; the registry's comparator judges the elaborated constants.
`scripts/check_definitions.py` compares the two files.
